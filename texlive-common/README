texlive-common distfiles for MacPorts TeX Live, 2023 release

This directory contains configuration files for a TeX Live
installation managed by MacPorts, and the scripts used for generating
them. They are unlikely to be useful except in the context of the
texlive-common port.

Most of the files contained here are used as the headers for the
configuration files texmf.cnf, texmfcnf.lua, fmtutil.cnf, updmap.cfg,
and language.{dat,def,lua}, which are later concatenated with other
configuration fragments installed by other ports. Many of these
headers contain placeholders such as @@PREFIX@@ which must be resolved
during installation. They are derived from the corresponding
configuration files from TeX Live, most of which are public domain.

texlive-update-cnf is the simple script used at runtime to regenerate
these configuration files from fragments. It is released into the
public domain.
